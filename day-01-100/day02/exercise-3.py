## Your Life in Weeks

# Instructions

Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. 

It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

> You have x days, y weeks, and z months left. 

Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers. 

**Warning** your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops. 

# Example Input

```
56
```

# Example Output

```
You have 12410 days, 1768 weeks, and 408 months left.
```
